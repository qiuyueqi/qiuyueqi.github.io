**Synopsis** <br>
**Keywords**: Low-Field MRI, Low-Field MRI, Diffusion

**Motivation**: DWI/DTI are very challenging in portable MRI system, while they play a pivotal role in timely triage, diagnosis and treatment for patients with suspected acute conditions such as stroke.

**Goal(s)**: To mitigate the effects of eddy currents and achieve multi-directional diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging in portable MRI system.

**Approach**: With the three-axis gradient coil accompanied with anti-eddy plate and image-phase based eddy current correction, we applied multi-scaning average to suppress noise and adopted eddy correction to mitigate the motion blurring.

**Results**: We succeed obtain visible multi-direction diffusion-weighted imaging and DTI imaging in portable MRI system.

**Impact**: With the three-axis gradient coil accompanied with anti-eddy plate and image-phase based eddy current correction, we succeed in obtaining multi-direction diffusion-weighted imaging and DTI images with the portable MRI system.
