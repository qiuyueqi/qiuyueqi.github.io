**Synopsis** <br> 
**Keywords**: MR-Guided Interventions, Low-Field MRI, Interventional navigation, portable MRI, EPI,high resolution ,real time imaging

**Motivation**: Low-field MRI's portability and safety make it appealing for real-time interventional navigation and bedside evaluations, but it lacks efficient navigation strategies.

**Goal(s)**: Our goal was to demonstrate the potential of low-field MRI in navigation by designing efficient and high-resolution echo-planar acquisition sequences.

**Approach**: We harnessed low-field MRI's long T2 and short T1 properties to design short-TR EPI sequences for real-time navigation and multi-shot EPI sequences for bedside postoperative assessments.

**Results**: With the short-TR 2D EPI sequence, real-time needle insertion images were successfully obtained, and was improved after denoising. In a self-made resolution phantom, the use of multi-shot EPI greatly improved the image resolution.

**Impact**: The combination of low-field portable EPI sequences and denoising algorithms highlights their time efficiency in navigation, thus expanding the prospects for low-field portable MRI in the field of navigation.
