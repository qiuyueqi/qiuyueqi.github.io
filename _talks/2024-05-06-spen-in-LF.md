**Synopsis**<br>
**Keywords**: Low-Field MRI, Low-Field MRI, SPEN, Field Inhomogeneity, less distortion, low SAR

**Motivation**: Geometric distortions in echo-planar acquisitions pose challenges for correction in portable low-field MRI due to significant field inhomogeneities.

**Goal(s)**: Our goal was to apply spatiotemporal encoding (SPEN) MRI at a 110 mT portable low-field system, aiming for nearly distortion-free echo-planar images.

**Approach**: We leveraged the low SAR in low-field MR to optimize the SPEN technique for substantial gains in sensitivity. SPEN-based 2D imaging ,3D imaging and DWI were compared with EPI-based imaging and EPI TopUp correction results.

**Results**: Approximately distortion-free SPEN acquisitions including robust 2D, 3D imaging and DWI demonstrated the potential clinical values of SPEN in the portable low field systems.

**Impact**: SPEN MRI provides a unique and robust fast echo planar acquisition approach to obtain nearly distortion-free images at low-cost portable low field systems, thereby expanding the prospects for rapid imaging, navigation, and functional imaging in portable low-field MRI.
