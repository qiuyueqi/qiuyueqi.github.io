**Synopsis** <br> 
**Keywords**:  Portable MRI, xSPEN

**Motivation**: In single-sided/built-in gradient portable low-íeld MRI systems, imaging suìers from severe distortions due to signiícant íeld inhomogeneity and gradient nonlinearity.

**Goal(s)**: Develop a multi-shot multi-echo cross-term Spatiotemporal Encoding (MSME xSPEN) sequence in a constant gradient low-íeld environment.

**Approach**: The MSME xSPEN technique, by designing a image-domain multi-shot technique, achieves multiple contrasts and higher acquisition eïciency. It was evaluated against traditional xSPEN using a 110mT portable MRI system that emulates a constant gradient low-íeld environment.

**Results**: MSME xSPEN exhibited in-plane resilience to íeld inhomogeneities and demonstrated higher SNRs with multiple contrasts compared with traditional xSPEN.

**Impact**: MSME xSPEN provides a novel image-domain distortionless acquisition approach for highly inhomogeneous low-íeld MRI systems. This technique will improve image quality and inspire new acquistion strategies in portable single-sided or built-in gradient systems.
