Research  Experience
======
* 2024.6-2025.3<br> <strong> Multi-Shot Multi-Echo xSPEN technique for permanent gradient portable low-field MRI systems</strong>
  -	Designed a new MS-ME xSPEN technique, to improve SNR and contrast diversity.
  - Applied it to portable MRI and systems with the constant gradient to resist the great field inhomogeneity and gradient nonlinearity.
* 2024.1-2024.6<br> <strong> New approach for multislice spatiotemporal encoding MRI in a portable low-field system </strong> 
  -	Multi-slice SPEN sequences design for a portable low-field MRI system operating at 110 mT
  - Tried multi-band RF technique on SPEN to improve SNR.
* 2023.1-2023.11<br> <strong>Spatiotemporal encoding MRI at a portable low field system </strong> 
  -	SPEN sequences design for a portable low-field MRI system operating at 110 mT
  -	Approximately distortion-free SPEN acquisitions were highlighted compared to the EPI acquisitions with TOPUP correction. Robust 3D SPEN MRI and diffusion SPEN MRI further demonstrated the potential clinical values in the portable low field systems.
* 2022.10-2023.11 <br> <strong> Comparison study between multi-field MRI </strong>
  -	Comparison of SNR, quantification fitting and protocol optimization for low field-MRI.
  -	Enabled similar contrasts of the typical clinical images at different fields.
* 2022.1-2022.6  <br> <strong> T2 shuffling at low-field MRI systems</strong>
  -	Exploited the physical advantages of low and medium fields to design fast multi-contrast sequences and low-rank reconstruction methods.
  -	Made full use of physical characteristics of low-fields to achieve high-quality multi-contrast imaging.
* 2021.9-2022.1 <br> <strong> Susceptibility-weighted imaging and protocol design at low-field MRI </strong>
  -	Optimized the imaging protocol to select the suitable parameters such as the values of TE, TR and the flip angle of the RF pulse according to the signal simulations for low-field SWI.
  -	The SWI results at 0.5T demonstrated the capability to identify magnetic susceptibility differences between variable tissues, especially, the blood veins.
