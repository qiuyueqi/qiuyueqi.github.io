**Abstract**
**Purpose**
Demonstrate the potential of spatiotemporal encoding (SPEN) MRI to deliver largely undistorted 2D, 3D, and diffusion weighted images on a 110 mT portable system.

**Methods**
SPEN's quadratic phase modulation was used to subsample the low-bandwidth dimension of echo planar acquisitions, delivering alias-free images with an enhanced immunity to image distortions in a laboratory-built, low-field, portable MRI system lacking multiple receivers.

**Results**
Healthy brain images with different SPEN time-bandwidth products and subsampling factors were collected. These compared favorably to EPI acquisitions including topup corrections. Robust 3D and diffusion weighted SPEN images of diagnostic value were demonstrated, with 2.5 mm isotropic resolutions achieved in 3 min scans. This performance took advantage of the low specific absorption rate and relative long TEs associated with low-field MRI.

**Conclusion**
SPEN MRI provides a robust and advantageous fast acquisition approach to obtain faithful 3D images and DWI data in low-cost, portable, low-field systems without parallel acceleration.
