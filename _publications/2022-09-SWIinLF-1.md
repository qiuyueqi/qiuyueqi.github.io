**Abstract**
The high-performance low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, equipped with modern hardware and contemporary imaging capabilities, has garnered interest within the MRI community in recent years. It has also been proven to have unique advantages over high-field MRI in both physical and cost aspects. However, for susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), the low signal-to-noise ratio and the long echo time inherent at low field hinder the SWI from being applied to clinical applications. This work optimized the imaging protocol to select suitable parameters such as the values of time of echo (TE), repetition time (TR), and the flip angle (FA) of the RF pulse according to the signal simulations for low-field SWI. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance, averaging multi-echo magnitude images and BM4D phase denoising were proposed. A comparison of the SWI in 0.5T and 1.5T was carried out, demonstrating the capability to identify magnetic susceptibility differences between variable tissues, especially, the blood veins. This would open the possibility to extend SWI applications in the high-performance low field MRI.
